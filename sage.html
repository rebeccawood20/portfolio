      <h2 class="largersectiontitle">The Brief</h2>
      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">What were the main aims?</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">In a team with three, I was tasked in a live brief with Sage whilst on work experience, to
        create a new and exciting app prototype to help business owners to keep in control of their finances, and feel
        confident about their business performance. In our team, we created two apps – one for small business owners to
        find work, communicate with their customers and get paid. The other app we created was something the customer
        could use to find tradespeople to do their work, keep in touch with the person carrying out their work, and pay
        when the work is complete. </p>

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Deliverables</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A fully functioning app prototype, showcasing the design concept</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Conduct usability tests, with real customers and make improvements based on your findings</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Compile and give a presentation, showcasing your concept at the end of your work experience</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Tools used</h4>

    <section>
      <h2 class="largersectiontitle">Understanding the brief</h2>
      <p class="projectbody">The first thing me and my team-mates did was to take a closer look at the brief, so we
        could fully understand the requirements. </p>

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">The scenario</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">We had a read of the brief, and then really expanded on the scenario and persona of Gary
        Timpson, within it. We thought about the whole process of Gary finding a new job, to getting paid for it – so we
        were able to really understand the whole process and figure out the pain points at different times. </p>
      <img src="" width="100%" height="100%" ;>

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Competitor research</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">We then had a little look at the competition. We looked at some examples/inspiration of UI,
        and then looked at some functional features from examples from dribble and other inspiration based websites. We
        also made sure to have a look at Sage’s main competitors – Xero, Quickbooks etc to see what they were doing, and
        how we could better that in this new app.</p>

    <section>
      <h2 class="largersectiontitle">Google sprint workshop!</h2>
      <p class="projectbody">One of the highlights for me from this project, and where the majority of the development
        occured was the Google Sprint Workshop we did on one of the days. The idea of a google sprint is that you and
        your team ideate, and develop/prototype an app within 5 days (a week). You can see what we got up to on our
        first day of Google Sprint below. We only did one day due to time constraints, but managed to get loads done.
      </p>

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Creating "how might we's"</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">First, we created ‘how might we’s’ to answer various questions that were related to the new
        app. For example; how might we “make products accessible for all?.” Some of these were quite specific and others
        were rather specific, but the exercise definitely helped me and my team-mates think of various questions and
        thoughts about the problems we could solve, based on the elaboration of the user scenario given in the brief.
      </p>
      <img src="" width="100%" height="100%8">

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">A 2 year goal</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">After creating ‘how might we’s’ we grouped them into key themes (seen above), and then the
        leader (facilitator) of the sprint, picked the one’s that were the most important. We then went onto define
        optimistic 2 year goals for the new service we were going to create. The facilitator would then choose the 2
        year goals that he thought was the most important, after the team voted too.</p>
      <img src="">

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Questions to consider/ask</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">We then moved onto think of some questions, that had an aim of raising potential issues
        with how we would achieve our 2 year goal. These were more pessamistic than the 2 year goal task, however they
        were helpful in raising questions. After we explained each of ours, the facilitator chose what he considered to
        be the most important, after we all voted and explained our questions.</p>
      <img src="">

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Mapping the system</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">The next thing we did was to map the whole business owner, and customer journey. This
        helped us a lot about the process both the customer and business owner would go through to have a successful
        trade of money for a service given (ie- plastering). It also helped us to hone in on one area of the journey.
      </p>
      <img src="">

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Picking an area to focus on</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">After mapping out the whole journey of both the business owner and the customer, we placed
        the ‘how might we’s’ onto the journey where they were relevant, and we also split the journey up into clear
        segments which helped us when picking a part to focus on.</p>
      <img src="">

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Idea sketching</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">After choosing to initially focus on the process of finding a job, and giving a quote from
        the business owners perspective – we moved onto to do some idea sketching for 10 minutes or so. You can see me
        doing some sketches below.</p>
      <img src="">

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Crazy 8's</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">I was then tasked with taking one idea that I had from the idea sketching, and to try and
        come up with eight different ways to do it. This helped me to really stretch one idea to within an inch of it’s
        life and to explore various possibilities.</p>
      <img src="">

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">3 Step concept</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">After this, we were tasked with creating a 3 step concept of part of the journey. In mine,
        the journey I focused on comprised of the customer searching for a job, through to a site visit being organised.
        I also looked at a dashboard view of a jobs list from the point of view of the business owner. The outline of
        the journey is explained below.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>The customer searching for a tradesperson to do their work</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The customer finds the perfect tradesperson to complete their work</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The business owner then gets notified of a job request</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The business owner would then view details of the job</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The customer and business owner would use the messaging feature on the app to organise a site visit</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="largersectiontitle">Further design development</h2>
      <p class="projectbody">After completing the Google Sprint process, I then moved on with my team to think about the
        screens to focus on, with our presentation in mind and what we needed to create to tell a compelling story.</p>

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Mapping out the app flow and structure</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">Before jumping onto Sketch, we mapped out the story we wanted to tell within our
        presentation, and then began structuring the pages. We also allocated screens for each one of us to create to
        make sure the workload was split fairly.</p>
      <img src="" width="100%" height="100%">

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Designing the screens and prototyping in Sketch</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">Next, me along with my three team mates went onto Sketch, and created the screens for the
        app. Me and one of my team mates worked on a business owner-based app, and my other team mate worked on a
        customer app, although we did help each other whenever it was needed. We constantly improved the screens to get
        to the one’s below. <br>

        Aswell as creating the screens, we linked them all up, following the flow that we had planned out, and used
        Marvel to add new animations. <br>

        We did start off by creating around 8 screens which we did use for our presentation, but we had time to create
        the start of the whole app, which was a great achievement!

    <section>
      <h2 class="largersectiontitle">Testing the prototypes</h2>
      <p class="projectbody">After creating prototypes for both apps using Sketch and Marvel, it was time to test with
        users to find what worked well, and the areas for improvement</p>

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Planning the user testing sessions</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">I took on the role of planning the questions and format that all of the user testing
        sessions would follow. You can see from the images below the questions that I planned out for both app
        prototypes.</p>
      <img src="">
      <img src="">
      <img src="">

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Changes to be made</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">From the user testing sessions, we all came together sharing the feedback we received, and
        grouped each set of feedback into clear sections. We made as many changes, as it was possible to make in the
        time we had (1 day).</p>
    </section>


    <section>
      <h2 class="largersectiontitle">Final results</h2>
      <p class="projectbody">After making the changes, you can see the two apps that we created. We decided to create a
        customer app – where they would be able to advertise work, and find tradespeople – along with a business owner
        app where they could find new work, and keep in contact with their customer, and receive payment for work
        completed. Both prototypes were created in Sketch and Marvel</p>

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Final prototypes</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">You can see the two prototypes we created in Sketch and Marvel below. The customer app is
        one of left, and the business owner app is on the right.</p>
      <!-- figure out how to insert prototypes (interactive) -->

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Presenting to the wider Sage business</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">After creating both of our prototypes we gave a presentation back to the Sage business. We
        presented with around 150 people in the room, and a large number of people dialling in to watch from around the
        world! We presented to other designers, finance and even the chief design director – which was really
        nerve-wracking, but also a great thing for me to further develop my public speaking confidence! It was something
        that I enjoyed as part of the experience.</p>

    <section>
      <h2 class="largersectiontitle">Reflection</h2>
      <p class="projectbody">Upon completing the project, I had a think about what I learnt from it, and what I would
        have improved if I were to complete it again. </p>

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">What did I learn?</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">This project was a great one, and was the first time I’d been given quite a lot of
        responsibility, within a live brief. I felt great pride in working for a large organisation such as Sage, and
        contributing to a possible new app. I hugely developed my communication and public speaking skills by carrying
        out my own user testing sessions with real users, and presenting to the wider Sage business. I also developed my
        technical knowledge of software including Sketch, Marvel and Zoom which I will definitely use in the future.
        Learning about the Google Sprint process, was extremely valuable for me, and really gave me an insight into how
        organisations and designers work through problems quickly. The experience also taught me the value of user
        research. This was something that previously, I didn’t really see the value of as much as I do now.</p>

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">What would I have improved?</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">Overall, I think the app looks great and I think we worked really well in a team to produce
        it. Our presentation went well, and we seemed to get positive feedback. We also had generally positive feedback
        from our user testing, although some problem areas were raised; such as the fact that not all tradespeople would
        look for work, and that the quote process is often discussed verbally and are quite informal. Working on these
        improvements along with others, is something I would do if we had the chance to improve or work on this brief
        again. I also would have tried to create more screens to fill out some gaps in the user flow, and maybe would
        have slightly tweaked and improved the UI of some screens.</p>
