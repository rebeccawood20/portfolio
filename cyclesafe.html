      <h2 class="largersectiontitle">The Brief</h2>
      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">What were the main aims?</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">In this project I was required to create a sensor based interface to allow users to
        interact with an audio-visual environment. This could be based on a physical computing model using tools such as
        the Arduino System, or a motion tracking experience using the Gesture and Media System (GAMS) at the Northern
        Dance in Ouseburn. For my submission, I decided to create an interactive cyclist jacket aimed at keeping
        cyclists safe when riding on the roads. I created it using Arduino Lilypad, and the jacket contains signalling
        lights, brake lights and visibility lights, which would have been triggered by button presses on the sleeves
        (although I couldn’t get this to work). You can see my development below. </p>

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Deliverables</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>A functioning prototype of the idea</p>
        </li>
        <li>

    <section>
      <h2 class="largersectiontitle">Ideation</h2>
      <p class="projectbody">The first thing I needed to do was to think of an idea. So, this first section is all about
        the ideation work I did when trying to come up with one main idea to tailor my work around. </p>

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Brainstorming</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">I've always found brainstorming a useful tool for coming with many ideas around a single
        topic. So, I started brainstorming as many ideas as I could that fit the brief</p>
      <img src="" width="100%" height="100%" ;>

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Three top ideas</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">From my brainstorm, I picked what I thought were the top three ideas, and went on to
        develop them further, with drawings and more detailed explanations of each idea. From this, I then chose one to
        focus on.</p>

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Chosen Idea</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">The idea I went for is the interactive cyclist jacket. I chose this idea because I saw real
        value in it. I spoke to a couple of friends and family members who are keen cyclists, and they seemed to like
        the idea. I also wanted to give myself a challenge and try something I had never done before or used before
        (Arduino Lilypad).</p>
    </section>



    <section>
      <h2 class="largersectiontitle">Research</h2>
      <p class="projectbody">After deciding on the idea, I decided to carry out some research to understand the issue of
        safety in cycling, and see what has already been created to help the issue.</p>

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Competitor Research</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">After choosing the idea, I took a look online to see what was already out there. It was
        important to do this, to check that my idea was unique and innovative in it’s own right. You can see all of the
        competitor research within my design document. </p>
      <img src="" width="100%" height="100%8">

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Cycling safety research</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">I also carried out some general research into cycling safety, as my idea was based around
        it so I thought it was important to understand the issue in further detail.</p>
      <img src="">
    </section>


    <section>
      <h2 class="largersectiontitle">User research</h2>
      <p class="projectbody">After conducting some initial research, I moved onto conducting some user research. This
        was so I could really understand my audience who may use the jacket, and the features they would want in
        something like this.</p>

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Creating personas</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">To kickstart my user research, I identified the main audiences that would use the jacket,
        and I created two personas, both stating different use cases.</p>
      <img src="" width="100%" height="100%">

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Survey results</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">I also carried out a survey to further understand what people using the jacket would
        potentially want from it (ie- features, aesthetics, colours, branding). I also asked questions to gauge what
        general, the biggest safety concerns were for cyclists, so I could then try to integrate these into the jacket.

    <section>
      <h2 class="largersectiontitle">Brand development</h2>
      <p class="projectbody">Although branding wasn't the most important part of the project, I wanted to give it a good
        name, and create an identity to tie everything together.</p>

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">What to call it...</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">First things first was to develop a name. I brainstormed a few ideas, and decided in the
        end to go with Cyclesafe. I think this helps to explain what the jacket is just by the name.</p>

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Identity inspiration</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">When developing an identity, I wanted to keep it simple. I had a look at some existing
        cycling brand identities, and took inspiration from these when designing the identity for cyclesafe.</p>

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">The Cyclesafe brand</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">For the cyclesafe brand, I decided to go for a simple word-mark rather than an identity
        incorporating imagery or an icon.</p>

    <section>
      <h2 class="largersectiontitle">Building the jacket</h2>
      <p class="projectbody">After creating my brand, and deciding what the features of the jacket were going to be, I
        got started with building the jacket! </p>

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Figuring out what I need</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">I knew that the first thing I needed to do was compile a list of everything I needed to
        create what I envisioning. So, I listed the features I wanted to integrate, and the components I would need for
        each. You can see the mind map I did below for this. Although some features such as the messaging turned out not
        to be legible given the timeframe, and the expense of the components I would have needed to make it work.</p>
      <img src="">

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Schematic sketches</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">For each feature of the jacket, I then drew out some schematic sketches so I could further
        understand how everything would connect up. I wanted to be sure of exactly what I was going to do before sewing
        everything in place- therefore minimising the margin for error.</p>
      <img src="">

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Building the jacket</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">I followed the schematic drawings that I created above, and then went onto build the
        jacket, sew the components in and connect everything using conductive thread so that it would work</p>
      <img src="">
      <img src="">

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">A few issues!</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">I encountered a few issues when creating the jacket:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Me falling off my bike, and ripping a huge hole in the jacket, and cutting part of the circuit</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The Arduino Lilypad port (the thing that connects it to the computer, and allows me to upload code to the
            board) broke two days before the deadline which left me with a big problem, especially as I needed to film
            the
            jacket working, and I was unable to even power the board with this issue, or upload code to the Lilypad.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>I was unable to get the buttons on the sleeves to control the LEDs even though this was my vision. It
            wouldn’t have worked because the conductive thread would have crossed, and caused a short. I did try to find
            a
            way around this, but was unable too in the design phase, and when figuring out where everything was going to
            go.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="projectbody">
        I did manage to solve the first issue by sewing up the hole, and resewing the connections back to the Lilypad.
        However, the second issue required more of a temporary solution (just so I could get my video filmed). I had to
        purchase another Lilypad and make temporary collections with crocodile clips. This did work (amazingly!), and
        allowed me to film my video! However, I couldn’t get the buttons connected up to control the LEDs for the
        reasons mentioned above.</p>

    <section>
      <h2 class="largersectiontitle">Final results</h2>
      <p class="projectbody">After overcoming various obstacles, I finished creating the jacket using Arduino Lilypad!
        You can see the final video below.</p>

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Video documentation</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">As part of the submission, I was required to produce video documentation of my project
        functioning. It was up to me to decide the format of the video (ie- an advert, or more of a technical
        explanation of how the product worked). I decided to go for an “advert style” video that would show off the
        various features of the jacket. To see more about how I planned and created the video, see my design document.

    <section>
      <h2 class="largersectiontitle">Reflection</h2>
      <p class="projectbody">Upon completing the project, I had a think about what I learnt from it, and what I would
        have improved if I were to complete it again. </p>

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">What did I learn?</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">This project was a very challenging one, especially having encountered many problems during
        the creation of the jacket which acted as grave setbacks. However, during the project I learnt a lot about
        Arduino Lilypad, having built up my knowledge from scratch. I did encounter many issues throughout the building
        aspect of this project, but it did improve my problem solving skills!</p>

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">What would I have improved?</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">If I were to do the project again, or if I had more time I would have tried to somehow get
        the buttons to control the LEDs. I would have also probably tried to include the messaging aspect, by purchasing
        the extra materials. I would have also had the branding stitched into the jacket to make it look a little bit
        more professional and to give it a more ‘finished’ look.</p>
