      <h2 class="largersectiontitle">The Brief</h2>
      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">What were the main aims?</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">In this project I was required (working in a group of three), to come up with a brand new idea that in no way currently existed. We were then tasked with creating a video to demonstrate the video, along with design fiction artefacts in the form of image and text/written work.  The creation of the video was a team task, and the creation of the design fiction was individual (using the collective idea). </p>

        <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Deliverables</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><p>A video showing the main idea (either an advert style, or another format; an example being a news report style video).</p></li>
          <li><p>Pieces of design fiction, that speculatees about a future with our chosen technology/idea. For the design fiction, I was required to create both text (written) pieces, and image pieces.</p></li>
          <li><p>A design journal, with background work for the video and for the creation of the design fiction, along with other tasks completed in class.</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Tools used</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Adobe illustrator</p></li>
            <li><p>Adobe InDesign</p></li>
            <li><p>Adobe photoshop</p></li>
          </ul>

<h2 class="largersectiontitle">Ideation</h2>
  <p class="projectbody">In this project, it was all about the idea! Me and my group came up with some ideas to take forward into our video. </p>

<h4 class="subsectiontitle">Chosen idea</h4>
<p class="projectbody">We settled on the idea of ‘using calories as a currency.’ So, in essence, our idea is – a world where you burn calories to make money, where you could build up “calorie cash” and spend this on everyday items. Our vision would be that the more calories you burn, the more cash you’ll have to spend – therefore motivating people to live a healthier lifestyle. We took inspiration from the movie – “In Time”, and the technology would display the calories burned as a hologram on somebody’s wrist.</p>
  <img src="" width="100%" height="100%";>

  <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Does the idea exist?</h4>
    <p class="projectbody">The most important thing was to check that the idea didn’t exist! We carried out some research just to check. We found some articles which referenced a similar idea, but not one exactly the same. You can view these below.</p>
     <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/worldbuilding/comments/12uw9y/a_world_ where_calories_are_currency/">A world where calories are currency (opens in a new tab)</a>

<section> 
  <h2 class="largersectiontitle">Brand development</h2>
    <p class="projectbody">After deciding on the idea, we thought it would be good to develop a brand and a name, just to include this in our video and in my design fiction. We went with the name ‘Cal Cash.’ We thought it made sense as you are burning Calories to make cash. We thought it was quite snappy and catchy.</p>
  
  <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Identity ideas</h4>
    <p class="projectbody">I developed the brand identity myself, and wanted something quite simple – as did the rest of my team. I thought that a flame representing calories along with a nice soft typeface would create an identity that channelled Fitbit, so could be quite effective. You can see some of the experimentations I below, with flame types, colours gradients and text colours.</p>
      <img src="" width="100%" height="100%8">
     
  <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Final identity</h4>
    <p class="projectbody">After doing a little experimentation, I decided on a final logo that would be used, as it was my responsibility. The final logo, and an example of how the logo can be used on top of video are displayed below.</p>

  <section> 
    <h2 class="largersectiontitle">Video work</h2>
      <p class="projectbody">After deciding on the idea and developing a identity, me and my team mates decided to develop the video. My individual role in the video was setting up the initial structure, developing personas for the video to be based around, and filming along with one of my team mates. Each of these stages is explained below.</p>
    
    <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Personas</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">As a group we thought that the creation of personas was important, so were able to have something to base our video around, and to help give it some structure. We collectively developed the three persona ‘types’, as a fitness person, office worker/somebody with a sedentary lifestyle, and a manual/blue collar worker as can be seen below (from my document/journal).</p>
        <img src="" width="100%" height="100%">
       
    <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Storyboard planning</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">I then went onto plan the storyboard, by essentially thinking about the various frame types and using the personas, I planned out a “day in the life” for each persona to help plan the video.</p>
      <img src="">

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Moving storyboard</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">Using my plans for the storyboard, and personas my team-mate used her I-Pad to put together an animatic of what the final video could look like. You can see this below.</p>
      <img src="">

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Final video</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">After we presented the animatic, we made some slight changes to the video storyboard, and then went onto film and put together the final video. We filmed near where I live, and we then edited the video together.</p>

    <section>
    <h2 class="largersectiontitle">Design fiction (individual work)</h2>
      <p class="projectbody">Based on the work we had done, coming up with the idea – I, as part of the individual section of the brief was required to produce design fiction in the form of image work and text work.</p>

    <h4 class="subsectiontitle">What is design fiction?</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">Design fiction is a design practice aiming at exploring and criticising possible futures by creating speculative, and often provocative, scenarios narrated through designed artefacts. 
        “Artefact” in my case is the text and image work which is explained in more detail below. </p>
    </section>
      
      
      <section>
        <h2 class="largersectiontitle">Text work</h2>
      <p class="projectbody">So, after coming up with an idea and filming the video, it was time to begin the text work as part of my individual submission. </p>

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Mindmapping ideas</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">I started by mind-mapping a few ideas, that I had for the text work. I was only planning on doing maybe two text artefacts, and 2-3 image artefacts, so had some choice from the ideas I came up with.</p>
      <img src="">

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Newspaper article.</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">The first idea I created for my text work was a newspaper article. The premise of the article is that somebody essentially takes Cal Cash too far, and becomes obsessed with losing calories. This was a speculative approach, and something that could happen if this were a real technology.</p>
      <img src="">

      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">All secrets uncovered / blog type article</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">My second piece of text work was a ‘all secrets uncovered’ type article, that is in the format of a ‘Wired’ article. I wanted the article to be very speculative, and how the technology could be used and vague rather than specific in how it could be used. I mocked up the clip view of the article below, and the wrote the full article and mocked this up so it looked like it was within a Wired article/webpage.</p>

    </section>


    <section>
      <h2 class="largersectiontitle">Image work</h2>
    <p class="projectbody">After completing my text work, I went on to complete my image work. </p>

    <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Mindmapping ideas</h4>
    <p class="projectbody">The first thing I did when planning my image work, was to brainstorm some ideas. As I could only think of three good ideas, I wanted to do all of them.</p>
    <img src="">

    <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Billboard</h4>
    <p class="projectbody">So the first image piece I created was the billboard. I wanted something quite simple, that summarised the technology well and showed it being used on someone’s wrist. I created the billboard on photoshop, and edited a watch that was on the wrist – out. I then mocked up the billboard in a bus stop as can be seen by the second image. I was really happy with how it turned out.</p>
    <img src="">

    <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Magazine article</h4>
    <p class="projectbody">The second piece of image work was the magazine advert. I really tried to channel one of the personas of the fitness person, and created the magazine advert on illustrator. I also mocked up a magazine page to give it a more realistic feel.</p>
    <img src="">
    <img src="">

    <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Poster</h4>
    <p class="projectbody">I then, decided to create a poster that would act as a form of advertisement. I liked the tagline – ‘Being active is your biggest earner’, as I think it sums up the idea really well, and is quite short. I created the design on illustrator, and then added it to a poster mockup as can be seen below.</p>

    <section> 
      <h2 class="largersectiontitle">Reflection</h2>
        <p class="projectbody">Upon completing the project, I had a think about what I learnt from it, and what I would have improved if I were to complete it again. </p>
      
      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">What did I learn?</h4>
        <p class="projectbody">I really liked this project, mainly because it was something a little bit different to other projects – such as app prototyping and web design. I really learnt about the value of ideas on the project. I learnt that its better to come up with as many ideas, no matter how wacky they sound, and this has improved me as a designer. I also really developed my writing skills, by creating the text element of the design fiction. I also developed my video shooting skills, and showcased my ability to work in a team successfully.  I ended up reciveiving a grade of 80% (1:1) for this project, so I was really happy with that!.</p>

        <h4 class="subsectiontitle">What would I have improved?</h4>
        <p class="projectbody">I think the only element I would improve would be to try and create more design fiction – especially on the text side, just to really explore what the implications of the technology would be if it existed. I was really happy with the video we created, and my own image work as well as my documentation, so i’m not sure what I would improve on that side of things.</p>
