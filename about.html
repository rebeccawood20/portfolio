      <p>I'm a final year student, studying BA (Hons) Interaction Design at Northumbria University, and I will be graduating in June 2021.</p>
      <p>I‚Äôm simply a student who loves all things design! I‚Äôm always up for challenging work that provides the
        opportunity to positively affect people on a broad scale.</p>
      <p>Recently, I spent 9 months at HMRCs offices in Longbenton, as an Associate Interaction Designer - being part of
        multiple
        scrum teams to design and develop public government services such as high profile projects including the <a
          class="main-nav" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/claim-a-grant-through-the-coronavirus-covid-19-self-employment-income-support-scheme">Self Employed Income Support scheme</a>, <a class="main-nav"
          href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/common-transit-convention-countries">Common Transit Convention</a> (a Brexit project), and the <a
          class="main-nav" href="https://www.gov.uk/trusts-taxes">Trusts registration service</a> so was designing and building
        services to be used by millions of people. Along the way, I also learnt a lot about <a class="main-nav" href="https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/02/dos-and-donts-on-designing-for-accessibility/">accessible design</a>,
        and how to design digital services for everyone to use, which I found really interesting.</p>
      <p>As well as my day to day work, I love to brush up on my coding knowledge (html, css, nunjucks, javascript), and
        I'm looking to learn react! I'm always trying to learn new
        things to improve as a designer.</p>
      <p>To let off steam, I used to do figure skating competitively, but I'm now looking into surfing as a new hobby (I
        live right on the beach, so it seems like a no brainer)! I'm also into
        <a class="main-nav" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caster_board">ripsticking</a>(like a kind of skateboard), so love riding
        that in my spare time. I love going for long walks, and also love dogs (I used to have a retired guide dog) and miss life with a dog, so am trying to persuade my parents to buy a new labrador puppy ü§ûüèª<br>
      </p>
      <p>I'm always open to new opportunities to develop as a designer, and to learn from as many talented people as
        possible, so if you want to <a class="main-nav" href="contact.html">get in touch</a>I'd love to hear from you!

          <h6>September 2019 - June 2020</h6>
          <p>Working in a team of three, I developed an-in depth app prototype, with the purpose of helping business
            owners find work, keep in contact with their customers, and send invoices. We also developed a companion
            customer app using Sketch and Marvel. We worked using the Google Sprint methodology, and presented to the
            wider Sage business. </p>
