    <div class="aboutprofile">
      <p>I'm an Associate Interaction designer at HMRC, and I currently study Interaction
        Design at Northumbria University. I started in design kinda by chance, and have grown
        to love it! I'm mainly interested in human-centered design and how we can really solve issues for users.
        This has become more of a priority to me when desiging, since I completed my 9 month placement at HMRC.
        The way I worked there was very different to what I was used to, and it really helped me to develop my
        skillset.</p>
