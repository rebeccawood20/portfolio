    <h3>The Brief</h3>
    <p>In this brief, I needed to choose an interface to redesign. I decided on the Rightmove app, as I felt improvements could be made in all three areas, including usability, accessibility, and with the user interface.
    we were required to produce a project document, showing our design process, as well as the final product. I also produced two video walkthroughs showing various features of the prototypes that I made using proto.io,
    and Invision Studio.</p>
