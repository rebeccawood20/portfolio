      <h2 class="largersectiontitle">The Brief</h2>
      <h4 class="subsectiontitle">What were the main aims?</h4>
      <p class="projectbody">In this brief, I needed to choose an interface to redesign. I decided on the Rightmove app, as I felt improvements could be made in all three areas, including usability, accessibility, and with the user interface.
        we were required to produce a project document, showing our design process, as well as the final product. I also produced two video walkthroughs showing various features of the prototypes that I made using proto.io,
        and Invision Studio.</p>

        <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Deliverables</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><p>A fully functioning prototype that would illustrate my redesign concept</p></li>
          <li><p>A design document detailing my design process, and how I managed the project</p></li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Tools used</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Sketch</p></li>
            <li><p>Invision Studio</p></li>
            <li><p>Adobe InDesign</p></li>
          </ul>

<h2 class="largersectiontitle">Initial Research</h2>
  <p class="projectbody">The first thing I did in this project, was to carry out some initial research, which included looking into the current Rightmove app, and understanding what the feelings around the current app were.</p>

<h4 class="subsectiontitle">Looking into the current app</h4>
<p class="projectbody">The first step in my research, was to take a look at the current Rightmove app. I browsed through the app to get myself familiar with it's features, and to identify possible pain points in the user experience, and areas for improvement.

  <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Competitor research</h4>
    <p class="projectbody">I then, decided to take a look at some of the main competition so that I could see the features they had, and how they organised information. The main two competitiors are Zoopla and On the Market, so went through each app, and analysed each.</p>

  <h4 class="subsectiontitle">Looking at existing reviews</h4>
    <p class="projectbody">I also had a look at some reviews of the existing Rightmove app. These gave me great insight into how users felt about the app, and how it could be improved.</p>
      <img src="images/rightmove-reviews.png" width="100%" height="100%";>


      <p class="projectbody">I learned a lot from the research phase, and understand more about how the app can be improved. Some of the key issues are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Issues with consistency between the app and website - For example; the draw an area feature is avalable on the website when searching for a new property in the map view, but is not available on phone.</li>
        <li>No keyword search</li>
        <li>Cannot search for multiple properties</li>
        <li>Issues with the visual design, and with the filtering features on the app - not enough detail</li>
      </ul>

<section> 
<h2 class="largersectiontitle">User research</h2>
  <p class="projectbody">After conducting some initial research, I moved onto conducting some user research. This was so I could really understand my audience, and the different groups I needed to take into account when redesigning the app.</p>

<h4 class="subsectiontitle">Identifying the main audiences</h4>
  <p class="projectbody">To start my research, I identified the main audiences that would use Rightmove, and also looked on YouGov, at the most prominent user group of Rightmove. I found this to be middle aged females.</p>

<h4 class="subsectiontitle">Personas</h4>
  <p class="projectbody">After defining the main audiences, I created three personas to ullustrate the main audiences/users</p>
